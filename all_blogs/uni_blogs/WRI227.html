                        The only time I learnt about computing history was a quick mention of Ada Lovelace and 
                        Guido van Rossum 
                        during my first computer science (CS) class in university. The professor followed the 
                        lesson with “you don't need to know this for the test,” and like a stereotypical 
                        student I promptly forgot it.
        
                        <br><br>
                        CS courses emphasize skills like problem solving and communication, brushing over the 
                        history and ethical concerns of technology we use. History and ethics, however, shape 
                        the technology of today and tomorrow. 
        
                        <br><br>
                        I am taking Social Media and Content Creation as a part of my writing minor, where we 
                        touch on these topics. Whether you're a CS student like me, or someone interested in 
                        technology, these four topics I've learnt impact the technology you've likely used, are 
                        using, or will use in the future.

                    <p class="centred-subtitle-text"> The Gender Shift </p>
    
                    <p class="blog-font">
                        Today, we consider computer science and math male-dominated, but there were many early 
                        female contributions. 
    
                        <br><br>
                        The idea of computing came from looming, a female-dominated task and hobby. Specifically, 
                        the Jacquard loom used punch cards as guides on how to weave patterns into cloth. This 
                        idea of punch cards was the inspiration for early computers, which also used punch cards 
                        to input data.
    
                        <br><br>
                        Females also led the charge in computing with Ada Lovelace being the first computer 
                        programmer, and Black women being computers at NASA—solving complex equations before 
                        computers (the machine) were efficient enough.

                        <br><br>
                        Why the shift? One idea noted in a reading was invisible labour: work, including domestic 
                        labour and care, that is often not acknowledged or valued. Furthermore, invisible labour 
                        is often done by minorities, including women and/or people of colour, due to its lessened 
                        prestige and stability (Poell et. al, 2022). The contributions these women made are an 
                        example of invisible labour, because they were not really acknowledged, and I don't feel 
                        they still are today.

            <p class="centred-subtitle-text"> Porn Supporting New Technology </p>

            <p class="blog-font">
            Despite the controversies surrounding porn, various technology started or became affordable 
            thanks to people purchasing it for porn. In fact, I wonder if the types of technology listed 
            below would have developed as fast without the support of porn. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="blog-font">
                <u>Here are a few pieces of technology that the porn industry impacted:</u>
            </p>

            <ul class="blog-font">
                <li>
                    VHS prices were driven down because VHS allowed porn to be displayed unlike it's 
                    competitor Betamax. You may think this sounds crazy, but keep in mind half the videotapes 
                    sold in the USA contained pornographic material.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The DVD vs. Blu-ray battle somewhat mirrored VHS and Betamax's, but other factors 
                    like Warner Bros. making an exclusive deal with Blu-ray swayed the battle.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Electronic Card Systems became the first way to pay online, and it was created for and 
                    used by… you guessed it: porn sites.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="blog-font">
                You may be thinking I'm missing something that feels it should originate from the porn industry: 
                webcams. Surprisingly though, Cambridge set up the first webcam to check if the coffee pot was 
                empty without getting up. I guess the coffee addiction prevailed porn for this one.
            </p>

            <p class="centred-subtitle-text"> The Control Given to AI </p>

            <p class="blog-font">
                <i> Should a car hit a baby or elderly person? </i>

                <br><br>
                After playing Absurd Trolley Problems, we learnt researchers use comparable questions to see how 
                companies should train self-driving cars. The most fascinating part, in my opinion, is that the 
                culture of the country may impact what the car decides. For example, individualistic cultures 
                such as Canada, would rather hit the elderly and let the baby live.

                <br><br>
                AI can also control what we see online. Moderation by algorithms on social media can filter out 
                inappropriate content, but these algorithms do not understand the nuance of related content not 
                always being inappropriate. Research suggest this occurred with #gay on Tumblr, because #gay was 
                likely a tag included in pornographic or hateful content (Gillespie, 2018). 

                <br><br>
                It is further complicated when creators don't know what is allowed because social media platforms 
                like YouTube do not inform users of what the algorithms filter out. Then, creators rely on 
                “algorithmic gossip,” or the experiences others had with algorithms 
                (Dergacheva and Katzenbach, 2023).

            popular ad spot! I see why ad blockers exist when I read blogs. I hope you are having a great day! 
            Below this text is a line of brown and green evergreen trees." width="100%">

            <p class="centred-subtitle-text"> Well With All These Issues, is Hiding the Algorithms Good? </p>

            <p class="blog-font">
                There may be some background to why AI algorithms sound so hush-hush, and it may be by design.

                <br><br>
                Something computer scientists learn early on in their degree is abstraction and 
                encapsulation—hide how it works so the users focuses on what it does. For example, consider 
                mortgage application screening. This tool narrows the applicant pool, but the people at the bank 
                don't need to know how it works—just that it's selected the best candidates. Thus, abstraction 
                and encapsulation are taught as pillars to make code more secure, maintainable, and user-friendly. 

                <br><br>
                But as already mentioned, focusing on the what and not the how has its downsides. Even in the 
                example of mortgage application screening, 80% of Black mortgage applicants were denied a loan 
                because the algorithm was not exposed to a diverse set of data.

                <br><br>
                I believe companies should inform users of the factors that algorithms consider when making 
                decisions and what data these algorithms are trained on, without giving away the entire 
                algorithm. This way, these issues are avoided without completely revealing the algorithms.
            </p>

            <p class="centred-subtitle-text"> Conclusion </p>

            <p class="blog-font">
                These bits of history and ethics are only a touch of what I learnt in the first half of my 
                Social Media and Content Creation course, that I hope to keep in mind as I continue my CS degree. 

                <br><br>
                Likewise, I hope to inspire you to learn more about the history and ethics of the technology you 
                use. Asking why is not just an annoying question from a child; it can give vital insight into why 
                technology is the way it is today, and where it should go tomorrow.
