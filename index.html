                Hello, my name is Amber! I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, 
                with a major in computer science, minor in mathematical sciences, and minor in professional writing and communication.
                <br><br>
                Through my interdisciplinary interests, I am broadly interested in pedagogy and computing education research at the post-secondary level. 
                While my experience lies in in first-year writing, introductory programming, and machine learning education, I am also interested in upper-year computing and the intersection of communication and computer science.
                <br><br>
                Outside of academic and work endeavours, you'll often find me doing one of my many hobbies, including 
                reading, writing, crocheting, or playing cozy video games.
            </p>
