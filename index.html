                            My name is Amber Richardson, and I'm going into my second year at UofT, majoring in Computer Science, 
                            with a minor in Math and a minor in Professional Writing and Communication.

                            This little site is a project I embarked on after my first year at university to learn
                            HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Here, I will highlight my achievements and
                            write about my experiences throughout university.
                            <br><br>
                            I hope to update this page (especially the blog) over time, and I hope you enjoy!
