                    I enrolled in my high school's grade 12 Yearbook course (Visual Arts - Info/Consumer Design), where I both designed layouts
                    and wrote. During the semester, I applied for the Editor and Chief role, and after an interview became the 
                    Deputy Editor in Chief.
                    I remained in this role after the course concluded, and continued my duties during the 
                    Yearbook Club that ran until the end of the school year.
